Ableton Push Python Scripts
============

My customized Ableton Push MIDI remote python scripts directory

Features that I have changed:
 * Changed default Quantization to 75%
 * Changed the log messages to be a bit more personal
 * Added "Chromatic" as a scale option

Features I want to add:
 * Have the sequencer (drum rack) note view display for non drum racks
 * Change the default behaviour of the touchstrip to modwheel (perhaps a selector to change to pitchbend)
 * User mode VU meter
