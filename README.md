Ableton Push Python Scripts
============

If you like what I'm doing here... help a brother out :) -> <a href='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/20946'><img alt='Click here to lend your support to: Customized Ableton Push Config and make a donation at www.pledgie.com !' src='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/20946.png?skin_name=chrome' border='0' /></a>

My customized Ableton Push MIDI remote python scripts directory

Features that I have changed:
 * Changed default Quantization to 75%
 * Changed the log messages to be a bit more personal
 * Added "Chromatic" as a scale option

Features I want to add:
 * Have the sequencer (drum rack) note view display for non drum racks
 * Change the default behaviour of the touchstrip to modwheel (perhaps a selector to change to pitchbend)
 * User mode VU meter
